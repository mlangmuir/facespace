# Facespace

Facespace is a social network application I created as part of the Diploma of Web Development program at Concordia University. The project is similar to the cat Twitter clone project, which I also have as a public repository. A key difference is that this application has a sign-in function and uses session storage to keep the user logged in while they are using the application.

The project is not currently hosted but I have uploaded a video demo of my work at the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwQul3aFdc8&ab_channel=MatthewLangmuir

## Development

### Frontend

To run this app on the client side, you must first install yarn. Then, navigate to the frontend folder by typing `cd frontend`. Type `yarn dev:frontend` to start the frontend dev environment.

### Backend

In another terminal, type `cd backend` and install Express by typing `yarn add express`. Use `yarn dev:backend` to start the server.
